## How To Setup?

If you prefer, we have a step-by-step video tutorial â†“  
[![Video Tutorial](https://img.youtube.com/vi/Z7yEkFWy09s/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/Z7yEkFWy09s)

### **Prerequisites**

1. A [Discord](https://discord.com/) account :)
2. Node.js 18 (or above) - If haven't, go to https://nodejs.org to download and install the latest version
   - Type `node --version` in the terminal to confirm Node is properly set up. You should see something like this:
     ```
     v18.xx.x
     ```
3. An AWS account and AWS CLI
   - If haven't already, go to https://aws.amazon.com/ to register an AWS account
   - Download and install AWS CLI from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
     - Type `aws --version` in the terminal to confirm AWS CLI is properly set up. Something like this should show up:
       ```
       aws-cli/2.10.0 Python/3.11.2 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off
       ```
   - Setup AWS CLI credentials:
     - Login to your AWS account, click the account name at the top-right corner and click "Security credentials". Go to the "Access keys" section and create an access key. Notes down `Access key` and `Secret access key`  
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/get-aws-access-key.png" >
   - In the terminal, type:
     ```
     aws configure
     ```
     When prompted, enter the `Access key` and `Secret access key` you got from the last step (and optionally choose the "default AWS region" and "output format")
   - Once done, type `aws sts get-caller-identity` in the terminal to confirm the AWS CLI credentials are set up correctly. Something like this should show up:
     ```
     {
       "UserId": "1234567890",
       "Account": "1234567890",
       "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:xxx"
     }
     ```
   - Prerequisites done, now start the fun part :)

### **Set up MineCloud**

1. Pick a [Configuration Package](minecloud_configuration_packages/RELEASES.md) from your desired game. Next to the package you will see the corresponding MineCloud version (e.g. `MineCloud x.x.x`), download the  corresponding version from the [MineCloud release page](https://github.com/VeriorPies/Minecloud/releases) and unzip it.
2. Open terminal in the MineCloud project directory:
   - Install Node dependencies: `npm install`
   - Copy and paste the downloaded ***Configuration Package*** (e.g. `"1.19.4 Vanilla.zip"`) into the `/minecloud_configs` folder.
   - Install Configuration Package: `npm run install-minecloud-config-pack`
      - The following message should be printed:  
        ```
        Successfully installed <Configuration Package Name> configuration package.
        ```
4. Open `MineCloud-Service-Info.ts` and fill in the following fields:
   - `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`: Click the account name at the top-right corner of your AWS console and copy the `Account ID`
   - `AWS_REGION`: Pick a [region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) that's closet to you. Some example values are: `us-west-2`, `ap-northeast-1` or `eu-west-2`
   - `DISCORD_APP_ID` and `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`: Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click "New Application" to create a new Discord APP. On the "General Information" page, you will find the App Id and Public Key.  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/discord-app-id-and-public-key.png" >
   - `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Go to the "Bot" tab, reset and copy the token
     - This is the Discord BOT that will handle our commands. If there's no BOT shown, click the "Add Bot" button to create a one   
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/discord-bot-token.png" >
      <p align="center">
      You can optionally setup the BOT avatar<br>
      </p>
   - `DISCORD_CHANNEL_WEB_HOOK`:
     - Open regular Discord, go to the Discord server you want to add MineCloud to, choose a text channel, and click "Edit Channel".
     - Go to "Integrations" => "Webhooks", click "New Webhook" to create a new Webhook then copy it.
     - This text channel is where our VM server instance will send updates to
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/discord-channel-webhook.png" >
     <p align="center">
     You can also optionally set up the BOT avatar here<br>
     </p>
2. Deploy MineCloud
   - (Optional) Customize Deployment
     - Common customizable options (e.g. VM type, disk size...etc) can be found in `minecloud_configs\MineCloud-Configs.ts`
     - Follow the "Custom deployment" section on the [Configuration Package's home page](minecloud_configuration_packages/RELEASES.md) for games-specific customizations
   - Open the terminal in the MineCloud folder and enter `npx cdk list` to make sure the build pass. You should see the stack name being printed:
     ```
     <Stack Name>
     ```
   - Bootstrap your AWS account by running `npx cdk bootstrap aws://<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>/<AWS_REGION>`
   - Before deploying, read through the End User License Agreement for the game (ex: [Minecraft EULA](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula), [Factorio EULA](https://www.factorio.com/terms-of-service))
   - Enter `npx cdk deploy` to deploy the stack.
   - Sit back and relax, this will take like 5~10 minutes â˜•.
     - When you see a "The server instance is ready" message shown up in the Discord channel, this means your game server is almost ready to connect :)
3. Setup BOT for your Discord server
   - After MineCloud is deployed, go to your AWS [CloudFormation page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) (make sure to select the right AWS region)
   - Click on the deployed stack, go to "Outputs" and copy the value of "Discord Interaction End Point Url"  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/discord-interaction-url.png" >
   - Go back to your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), select the APP created, and paste the URL into the "INTERACTIONS ENDPOINT URL" field.  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/discord-interaction-url-dev-portal.png" >
   - Go to "OAuth2" => "URL Generator", select "application.commands" and click "Copy"  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/discord-url-generator.png" >
   - Open the copied URL (either in Discord or the browser) and add the BOT to your Discord server.
   - You are all set now - Type any command (ex: `/mc_restart`) in the Discord text channel to give it a tryðŸŽ‰!  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/discord-mc-start-command.gif" >

### **_ONE MORE THING!!!_**

If you have deployed MineCloud more than once, **THERE MIGHT BE DANGLING SPOT INSTANCE REQUESTS THAT WILL CONSTANTLY CHARGE YOU. MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR [EC2 SPOT REQUESTS TAB](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home#SpotInstances:) AND CANCEL THE DANGLING SPOT REQUEST IF THERE'S ANY!!**


## Managing the Server after Deployment
After Deployment, the server can be managed by SSH terminals and SFTP clients.  
MineCloud's working directory is  `/opt/minecloud` and the game server folder is located at `/opt/minecloud/server`.  
Different Configuration Packages may have different file-saving locations, please refer to the Configuration Package's homepage for more details.  

### Accessing the Server Terminal
The server can be connected via SSH, the easiest way to do it is by using the "Connect" button at the top-right of the EC2 instance page on the AWS console.   
For useful commands, please check out the [Useful Linux Commands](https://github.com/VeriorPies/MineCloud/wiki/FAQs-&-Troubleshooting#useful-linux-commands) section on the Wiki.   


### Interact with the Game Server
The game server is running in a [Screen](https://www.gnu.org/software/screen/) session. To interact with the game server:  
- Type `sudo screen -ls` to list out the screen session, and type `sudo screen -r` to enter the session 
- When done, use `Ctrl-a Ctrl-d` to exit the session.

### Manually Start/Stop the Game Server
To manually start/stop the game server:  
 - Pause the MineCloud service first: `sudo systemctl stop minecloud.service`
 - Go to the server directory with: `cd /opt/minecloud/server`, 
 - Manually start the game server: `sudo ./start_server.sh` 
 - Manually stop the game server: `sudo ./stop_server.sh`
 - Once done, Resume the MineCloud service: `sudo systemctl start minecloud.service`

 Usually, we will want to do this to make sure the server can start up correctly after we've made changes to the server files.  
 As long as `./start_server.sh` and `./start_server.sh` function properly, MineCloud service can start/stop the game server when the VM start and stop.  


### Managing Server Files
To make changes to the server files, connect to your EC2 instance with an SFTP client (ex: WinSCP).  

#### Step-by-Step Guide for Windows:  
- Download and install [WinSCP](https://winscp.net/eng/index.php)
- Install [PuTTY](https://www.putty.org/) (which should come with `PuTTY Key Generator`)
- Setup key pair:  
    - Open `PuTTY Key Generator` and click "Generate". When done, you should see your public key in the "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys" field
    - Turn on your EC2 instance, connect to the instance terminal via the AWS web console
    - Type `sudo nano .ssh/authorized_keys` to edit. Copy and paste in the public key from the "Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys" field as a new line and `ctrl+x` to save the file.  
    - In `PuTTY Key Generator`, click "Save private key" to save your private key.
    - Your key pair is ready now!
      > You can also use this key to SSH into your server with PuTTY client.
##### Transferring files via SFTP using WinSCP
  - Before connecting, you will want to change the files' owner first. To do so:  
      - In the EC2 terminal launched in previous steps. Run `sudo su` to become root user, and run `chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user /opt/minecloud/server` to change the owner of the server files to our WinSCP login user.
      - This is a workaround for our current user permission setup. We will further address this in future releases.  
  - In the EC2 terminal, run `sudo systemctl stop minecloud.service` to pause the MineCloud system service
  - Open WinSCP, paste in the server IP, click "Advanced" => "SSH/Authentication" and select the private key.  
  - Save and click "Login" to connect. Input "ec2-user" for the user name when prompted.   
  - You are all set now! Navigate to `/opt/minecloud/server` and start editing the server and world files.  
  - When done,  run `sudo /opt/minecloud/server/start_server.sh` to make sure the server can start properly and run `sudo systemctl start minecloud.service` to enable the MineCloud system service again.  

#### Step-by-Step Guide for Linux
- In your EC2 dashboard, click on `Key pairs`, click `Create key pair` on the top right corner.
- Enter key pair name then click `Create key pair` , your key pair will be downloaded to your /Downloads folder.
- Open up terminal on your local machine, navigate to the folder the key pair is stored.
- You need to make sure the pem file can only be access by yourself or else the ssh client will refuse to establish a connection with the server, thus you need to set the following file permission.

```bash
sudo chmod 400 "name of .pem"
```
- Type in the following command to extract the public key from the .pem file.

```bash
ssh-keygen -y -f "name of .pem"
```

- Copy the results, now turn on your EC2 instance and connect to it via the AWS web console .
- Edit the `authorized_keys` using the editor of your choice, eg.

```bash
sudo nano .ssh/authorized_keys
```

- Paste the public key at the top of `authorized_keys`. Save and exit.
- After all that you can finally connect to your instance using SSH by running the command:

```bash
ssh -i "name of .pem" <your instance's username>@<your instance's public ipv4 DNS>
```

- Example:

```bash
ssh -i SSH_SFTP.pem ec2-user@ec2-54-169-92-65.ap-southeast-1.compute.amazonaws.com
```
##### Transferring files via SFTP using Filezilla
- Connect to your instance via SSH or AWS web console and type in:

```bash
sudo chown -R ec2-user:ec2-user /opt/minecloud/server
```

- Install [Filezilla Client](https://filezilla-project.org/)
- Open Filezilla, open `Site Manager` by pressing `Ctrl + s`.
- Click on `New Site`, type the name of your server.
- `Protocol`: choose `SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol`.
- `Host`: paste in the `Public ipv4 address` of your instance.
- `Logon Type`: choose `Key file`.
- `User`: type in the username of your instance, default is `ec2-user`.
- `Key file`: select the pem file.
- Click `Connect` and you can start transfering files!


## Deploy Multiple Game Servers
- We can have multiple MineCloud game servers for a Discord server (ex: 1 Minecraft server and 1 Terraria server) 
- Every game server needs to have its own Discord Bot and CloudFormation stack name. CloudFormation Stack name can be set via the `STACK_NAME` field in `minecloud_configs/MineCloud-Configs.ts`. 
- We can also have 2 versions of the same game (ex: Minecraft Vanilla 1.19.4 and Minecraft Forge server 1.19.3) as long as they have different Stack names.
