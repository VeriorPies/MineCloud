MineCloud is an AWS CDK (Cloud Development Kit) project that allows users to set up an almost free on-demand Minecraft (or other game) server for their Discord server with minimal time.

*MineCloud comes with Minecraft server built-in but can be easily configured to host other multiplayer game servers as well. For more details, please check out the [Terraria example](https://github.com/VeriorPies/MineCloud/tree/Terraria).*

## How To Setup?

If you prefer, we have a step-by-step video tutorial â†“  
[![IMAGE ALT TEXT HERE](https://img.youtube.com/vi/6L-cPb_IOX4/0.jpg)](https://youtu.be/6L-cPb_IOX4)

### **Prerequisites**

1. A [Discord](https://discord.com/) account :)
2. Node.js 18 (or above) - If haven't, go to https://nodejs.org to download and install the latest version of Node.js
   - Type `node --version` in the terminal to confirm Node is properly set up. You should see something like this:
     ```
     v18.xx.x
     ```
3. An AWS account and AWS CLI
   - If haven't already, go to https://aws.amazon.com/ to register an AWS account
   - Download and install AWS CLI from [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)
     - Type `aws --version` in the terminal to confirm AWS CLI is properly set up. Something like this should show up:
       ```
       aws-cli/2.10.0 Python/3.11.2 Windows/10 exe/AMD64 prompt/off
       ```
   - Setup AWS CLI credentials:
     - Login to your AWS account, click the account name at the top-right corner and click "Security credentials". Go to the "Access keys" section and create an access key. Notes down `Access key` and `Secret access key`  
       &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/get-aws-access-key.png" >
   - In the terminal, type:
     ```
     aws configure
     ```
     When prompted, enter the `Access key` and `Secret access key` you got from the last step (and optionally choose the "default AWS region" and "output format")
   - Once done, type `aws sts get-caller-identity` in the terminal to confirm the AWS CLI credentials are set up correctly. You should see something like this:
     ```
     {
       "UserId": "1234567890",
       "Account": "1234567890",
       "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::1234567890:xxx"
     }
     ```
   - Prerequisites done, now start the fun part :)

### **Set up MineCloud**

1. Download the latest release from the [release page](https://github.com/VeriorPies/Minecloud/releases), unzip it and open `minecloud_configs/MineCloud-Configs.ts`, there're some parameters we have to provide first:
   - `AWS_ACCOUNT_ID`: Click the account name at the top-right corner of your AWS console and copy the `Account ID`
   - `AWS_REGION`: Choose a [region](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/using-regions-availability-zones.html) that's closet to you. Some example value are: `us-west-2`, `ap-northeast-1` or `eu-west-3`
   - `DISCORD_APP_ID` and `DISCORD_PUBLIC_KEY`: Go to [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications) and click "New Application" to create a new Discord APP. On the "General Information" page, you will find the App Id and Public Key.  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/discord-app-id-and-public-key.png" >
   - `DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN`: Go to the "Bot" page on the Discord Developer Portal, reset and copy the token
     - This is the Discord BOT that will handle our commands. If there's no BOT shown, click the "Add Bot" button to create a new BOT  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/discord-bot-token.png" >
        <p align="center">
        You can optionally setup your BOT avatar<br>
        </p>
   - `DISCORD_CHANNEL_WEB_HOOK`:
     - Open regular Discord, go to the Discord server you want to add MineCloud to, choose a text channel, and click "Edit Channel".
     - Go to "Integrations" => "Webhooks", click "New Webhook" to create a new Webhook then copy the Webhook URL.
     - This text channel is where our VM instance will send updates to
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/discord-channel-webhook.png" >
     <p align="center">
     You can also optionally set up your BOT avatar here<br>
     </p>
2. Deploy MineCloud
   - In the MineCloud project directory, type `npm install` in the terminal to install all dependencies
   - (Optional) Change Minecraft version OR provide your own world files
     - To change Minecraft version:   
     Replace `MINECRAFT_SERVER_DOWNLOAD_URL ` in `minecloud_configs\advanced_configs\minecraft-server-download-url.ts`. (The default Minecraft being downloaded is `1.19.4`)   
     There are some websites that collect the download links of older versions of Minecraft (ex: [MCVersion.net](https://mcversions.net/)) 
     - To provide your own world files:  
     Replace `minecloud_configs/server/server.zip` with your own Minecraft version/worlds (When packing the server executable, make sure `server.jar` are at the top level of the `server.zip` file)  
     After replacing `server.zip`, set `DEPLOY_LOCAL_SERVER_EXECUTABLE = true` in the `minecloud_configs/MineCloud-Configs.ts`
   - Open the terminal in the MineCloud folder and enter `npx cdk list` to make sure the build pass. You should see the stack name being printed:
     ```
     MineCloud
     ```
   - Bootstrap your AWS account by running `npx cdk bootstrap aws://<AWS_ACCOUNT_ID>/<AWS_REGION>`
   - Before deploying, read through [MINECRAFT END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT](https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/eula) and make sure you agree to it
   - Enter `npx cdk deploy` to deploy the stack.
   - Sit back and relax, this will take like 5~10 minutes â˜•.
     - When you see a "The server instance is ready" message shown up in the Discord channel, this means your Minecraft server is almost ready to connect :)
3. Setup BOT for your Discord server
   - After MineCloud is deployed, go to your AWS [CloudFormation page](https://console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation) (make sure to select the right AWS region)
   - Click on "MineCloud" stack, go to "Outputs" and copy the value of "Discord Interaction End Point Url"  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/discord-interaction-url.png" >
   - Go back to your [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications), select the APP created, and paste the URL into the "INTERACTIONS ENDPOINT URL" field.  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/discord-interaction-url-dev-portal.png" >
   - Go to "OAuth2" => "URL Generator", select "application.commands" and click "Copy"  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/discord-url-generator.png" >
   - Open the copied URL (either in Discord or the browser) and add the BOT to your Discord server.
   - You are all set now - Type any command (ex: `/mc_restart`) in the Discord text channel to give it a tryðŸŽ‰!  
     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <img width="80%"  src="images/discord-mc-start-command.gif" >

### **_ONE MORE THING!!!_**

If you have deployed MineCloud more than once, **THERE MIGHT BE DANGLING SPOT INSTANCE REQUESTS THAT WILL CONSTANTLY CHARGE YOU. MAKE SURE TO CHECK YOUR [EC2 SPOT REQUESTS TAB](https://console.aws.amazon.com/ec2/home#SpotInstances:) AND CANCEL THE DANGLING SPOT REQUEST IF THERE'S ANY!!**
